# Fitness Box - Your Fitness Community

Welcome to Fitness Box, an online forum where users can share their fitness journeys, seek advice, and connect with others who are passionate about health and wellness.

Fitness Box is designed to help you track and enhance your fitness journey. This is my first major project, and I’ve poured my passion and dedication into creating a platform where you can document your progress, set goals, and connect with a supportive community. The design of Fitness Box was inspired by the fantastic work in [this repository](https://github.com/divanov11/StudyBud/), which provided a solid foundation and valuable insights.

Join Fitness Box today and start sharing your fitness experiences, asking questions, and supporting others on their fitness journeys!
